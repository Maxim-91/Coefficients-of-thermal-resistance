# Thermal Coefficient of Resistance (TCR) Calculation Software

## Overview
This software performs calculations for theoretical modeling of the behavior of the TCR when the thickness of individual layers in a thin-film system changes. The modeling is based on a macroscopic approach.

## Models Used
The software utilizes the following model relationships for different cases:
- **Two-layer film system**: where the individuality of the layers is preserved (bimetal model).
- **Homogeneous system**: a thin-film alloy across the entire thickness of the original two-layer system.
- **Two-layer system with an intermediate layer**: a thin-film alloy near the interface.

## Geometrical Model
The geometrical model of a two-layer film system with an intermediate alloy layer near the interface:

## Software Features
The developed software enables TCR calculations based on two different models:
1. **Bimetal model**.
2. **Homogeneous alloy model**.
